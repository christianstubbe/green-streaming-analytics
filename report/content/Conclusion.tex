\section{Conclusion}

The main objective of this project is to tackle the issue of green streaming by developing a content based measurement system that tracks energy consumption per content played and displays the aggregated data on a dashboard. It can be concluded that the main goal of this project was achieved along with its deliverables, which include 

The main goal of this project was achieved, as we successfully developed a content-based measurement system to address the issue of green streaming. Our system effectively tracks energy consumption per content played and presents the aggregated data on intuitive Grafana dashboards. By accomplishing this objective, we have taken significant steps towards promoting sustainability in the streaming industry as well as aiding with green streaming related research .

In addition to achieving our main purpose, we have successfully delivered the following key deliverables:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Player Application: A user-friendly application that enables users to access and play demo videos, facilitating seamless interaction with the streaming platform \ref{fig:media_player1} \ref{fig:media_player2}.
  \item Backend Server: An efficient backend server that collects energy consumption data and stores Common Media Client Data (CMCD), ensuring the reliable storage and management of essential metrics.
  \item Grafana Dashboards: Comprehensive dashboards developed using Grafana, allowing stakeholders to analyze energy consumption data alongside CMCD metrics. These dashboards provide valuable insights into streaming patterns and energy usage, empowering decision-making processes \ref{fig:dash1} \ref{fig:dash2}.
\end{enumerate}

With these deliverables in place, our project has not only achieved its primary objective but has also provided tangible tools and resources to support ongoing efforts towards green streaming. We are confident that our system will contribute to greater awareness and accountability in the streaming industry, ultimately leading to a more sustainable future.
