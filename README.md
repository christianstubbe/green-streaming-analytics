# Green Streaming and Sustainable Content Delivery: Green Streaming Analytics

## Overview

Green streaming analytics is a testing environment to collect and analyze CMCD (Common Media Client Data). The aim of the project is to provide insights into streaming efficiency, resource utilization, and the environmental impact of video streaming.

The testing environment consists of a measurement server to collect CMCD and power consumption data, a measurement database to store the data and Grafana dashboards to analyze the data. The power consumption data can be collected with a NETIO-compatible device.

## Features

- Real-time streaming analytics
- Integration of CMCD and NETIO device data
- Grafana dashboard for visualization

## Architecture

The architecture of Green streaming analytics consists of the following components:

- **Data Ingestion:** CMCD and NetIO device data are ingested into the system.
- **Streaming Analytics:** Real-time analytics are performed on the combined dataset.
- **Data Storage:** Processed data is stored for historical analysis.
- **Grafana Dashboard:** A user-friendly interface for visualizing analytics results.

    participant nd as Netio Device

		
    Note over u: User enters <br/> Netio IP <br/> Netio Serial Number
        mp -->> ms: Post Netio ID, serial <br/> number and session ID
	Note over ms: Start Session 
	ms -->> nd: Request Netio data
	nd -->> ms: Get Netio device endpoint
	u -->> mp: Generated Sesion ID
	Note over ms: Store Netio data in Netio database
	Note over u, mp: Start Session
	loop Video Playback
		u --> mp: CMCD Collection
    	end
	mp -->> ms: Post CMCD data with keys 
	Note over ms: Store CMCD data <br/> in CMCD database
	opt Terminate Session
		u -->> mp: User terminates session
		mp -->> ms: Trigger session terminate endpoint
		ms -->> nd: Stop Netio Device Recording 
		Note over ms: Mark Session as terminated
	end
```

## Getting Started

To get started with Green streaming analytics, follow these steps:

1. Install Core Dependencies
    * [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/)

2. Checkout project repository (default branch: main)
    * ```git clone https://github.com/florian-baumann/awt_ws2324.git```

### Dockerization
To run Green streaming analytics using Docker and Docker Compose, follow these steps:

3. Create a new .env file by copying the provided template in the src directory:
	* ```cd src```
    * ```cp .env.template .env```
4. Build and start the services defined in *docker-compose.yml*:
	* ```docker compose up```
5. Access the application at http://localhost:5173.

### Usage

### Grafana Dashboard
Access the Grafana dashboard to visualize streaming analytics. The dashboard provides insights into:

* Content delivery efficiency
* Network and hardware resource utilization
* Environmental impact metrics
